  company: Bitpanda
  duration: Mar, 2022 &mdash; Present
  summary: >
    Helping build the company's data platform by setting up our database
    migrations CI pipeline with Flyway and Gitlab, writing DAGs and general
    Python abstractions for our Apache Airflow pipelines (via Astronomer)
    between, e.g. external APIs and our Snowflake data platform.

- position: Data Scientist
  company: Solgenium GmbH
  duration: Jan, 2021 &mdash; Feb, 2022
  summary: >
    Implemented the integration of statistical models into production for the
    company's main product (for healthcare workforce management); managed
    projects with healthcare clients to provide well-tested model predictions
    (from Bayesian GLMs) pertaining to staffing at healthcare institutions;
    managed Postgres data warehouse derived from past client data; Models and
    production code were written in a mixture of Python, R and SQL.

- position: Postdoctoral Researcher
  company: Czech Academy of Sciences
  duration: Feb, 2020 &mdash; Dec, 2020
  summary: >
    Extended the capabilities of the RepeatExplorer Pipeline by developing
    additional modules for detecting underlying structure of clustering results;
    Developed, tested and integrated numerous approaches to solving such
    problems including Bayesian models, hidden Markov models and simple
    heuristics using state-of-the-art machine learning libraries such as
    Pytorch, Jax and PyMC in Python.

- position: Researcher / Software Developer
  company: Radar Cyber Security GmbH
  duration: Mar, 2019 &mdash; Dec, 2019
  start_date: 2019/03
  end_date: 2019/12
  summary: >
    Researched, implemented and tested numerous novel statistical and deep
    learning models for anomaly detection in the field of cybersecurity;
    constructed predictive models using techniques such as dimensionality
    reduction (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP), Gaussian mixture models, variational
    autoencoders and other neural network models (RNNs, CNNs, etc.) tailored to
    company cybersecurity data; models were mainly implemented in Python using
    Tensorflow, PyTorch and other machine learning / statistical library
    mainstays.

- position: Postdoctoral Researcher
  company: Universität für Bodenkultur Wien
  duration: Feb, 2018 &mdash; Mar, 2019
  summary: >
    Performed genetic analysis of cultivated sugar beets and their wild
    relatives to better understand the geographical and genetic context for
    improving breeding programs and sugar production; developed statistical
    bioinformatic pipelines for analyzing large-scale genomic data;
    implementation of various steps in the pipeline included Illumina read
    mapping, dimensionality reduction and spatial genetic analysis to identify
    correlations between important biological traits and geography.
