    I have a lot of experience with the common machine learning

    standard library. Both in work and personal projects I am using Apache Airflow
    for ETL pipelines, Alembic / SQLalchemy for database and migrations, Docker
    and the Github Container Registry for building and storing images. I also have
    a good amount of experience with Github Actions and Gitlab CI/CD.

    In past work and personal projects I have used Google Cloud Platform and
    Amazon Web Services including managing data warehouses in BigQuery and
    RedShift, using cloud storage services like GCS and S3, as well as Cloud
    Composer and MWAA for Airflow pipelines. Recently, I have also started using
    Snowflake for data warehouse solutions and the Astronomer service for
    Airflow.
